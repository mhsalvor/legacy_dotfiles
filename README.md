# Legacy Dotfiles 

_Deprecated and broken old configuration file archive_

## These are not the Dotfiles you are looking for...
Once upon a time, On a laptop far away, I left the comfort and easy of KDE Plasma5 and jumped into the tiling WM world, finally settling on bspwm.
I didn't understand half of the stuff I put in dotfiles back then, but I was self isolating so I had too much time... And I needed to keep myself busy, so hacking away at a fresh installation of Manjaro i3 I went.

The results weren't great, but it kinda worked. For a while. 

## A New Laptop
Then I bought a brand new laptop to replace my aging potato, and all hell broke loose.

For a while, I bodged the critical stuff, and carried using an almost vanilla Manjaroi3 with my aliases and bashrc. 
Once again, It wasn't great, but it did the job. 

## The tinkering strikes back
If you are here looking for Dotfiles, you know the hitching. . 
I managed to keep it at bay, for a while, due to more important things filling my days. But alas, it could not be defeated.

A new and improved plan was made to tweak and customize my system, ggoing back to my tiling roots with i3 and eventually branching into Qtile and Awesome. 
That effort began with me renaming this repository and moving on from old defaults. You should too. 

## The return of the Dotfiles
These are here to stay, as a reference point and archive. 
But if you are looking for something to stea... _cough_... copy and adapt, I strongly recommend you check my "dotfiles" repository. 
There you will find up to date and actually working (no guarantees) files.
